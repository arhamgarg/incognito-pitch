## Project Details
-   As builders, oftentimes we have projects or ideas that we need to validate from our peers but are hesitant to approach out of insecurities, getting mocked, or looked down upon.
-   Build a platform where folks could sign-up and provide feedback on idea posts.
-   Ideas could be posted as a diagram + title + description
-   The ideator's identity remains anonymous
-   The validator's identity can either remain anonymous or they can choose to be seen.
-   Add some filtering to phase out useless or immaterial feedback. (also filter out objectionable / NSFW content)
